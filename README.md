# NN_for_Mnist_Numpy
Fully Connected Neural Network for Mnist image classification using numpy, matplotlib and tqdm. The code to download mnist was based on this [repository](https://github.com/hsjeong5/MNIST-for-Numpy). The initial code for the neural network was based on this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-code-a-neural-network-in-plain-numpy-ae7e74410795), however it was heavily changed to be used for classification problems.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Numpy 1.26
* tqdm 4.64.0
* matplotlib 3.4.3
